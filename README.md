# PRODIGY_CS_01 — Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool 🔐

Author: Adhi Narayan  
Internship: Prodigy InfoTech — Cyber Security Track  
Task: 01 — Caesar Cipher (Educational Encryption & Security Demo)


---

## 🔍 Project Summary

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the earliest classical encryption techniques.
The tool includes both encryption and decryption, along with simple cybersecurity-focused features to help beginners understand how substitution ciphers work and why they are easily breakable.

This project is built for learning and awareness — not for real-world secure communication.

* Decrypt the encrypted message using the same shift

* Supports both uppercase and lowercase alphabets

* Keeps numbers, spaces, and special characters unchanged

* Simple, clean, and beginner-friendly Python code

* Runs directly in the terminal with user input
